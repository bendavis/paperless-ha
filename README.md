# Paperless-ng Integration for Home Assistant

**This integration is very much a WIP**

An integration intended to provide sensors, and services for [paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) API to be exposed in Home Assistant. This project is an early work in progress.

# Current Progress

- Uses integration flow for configuration
- Uses paperless-api to fetch documents that can be rendered using [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card)

# Goals

- Easy document lookup by tag
- Exposes services to add/remove tags, documents, etc
- New document sensor, maybe exposing last added date
